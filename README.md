## Explanation
 The app allows you to connect car owners - those defined as drivers, to passengers - who are looking for an easy and convenient way to reach the same destination.
The purpose of the app is to reduce the use of as many vehicles as possible and make the most of the number of available spaces in each of them.
Several reasons have led to this goal:
From an environmental point of view - reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
Relieving traffic congestion.
Economic savings - the passenger participates in the travel expenses with the driver who owns the fuel only.

In the project we worked with the development methodology - Scrum.

The development tools I worked with: Android Studio.

MongoDB based database.

Authentication of users using Firebase.

The languages we used for development:

* Mobile / Android application - in Java.
* Web and server side application - Angular, NodeJS.
* Matching Algorithm - Java.
* Using the external API of Google, Facebook, MongoDB:
* Providing an option to connect with an existing Google / Facebook user.
* Using the Google Map tool.
